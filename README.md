# Quicksort

Implement an iterative (no recursive calls) version of quicksort. Use the
template I've provided in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some
basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

Hint: To make quicksort iterative, think about the part of the array each
recursive call considers.

#2-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vtckgz38QHs&t=675s_ Learned about quicksort algorithm here and used this methods to build the recurrsive version of the algorithm to practice. 

#3- Got help from my roomate with some ideas for how to write the algorithm iterativly, specically he suggested using the zero array to check if my list was sorted, which I implemented in my final code. No code was given to me we only walked through psudo code and represenations on white boards.
